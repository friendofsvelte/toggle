## Custom action

You can also use the `toggle` action to toggle the theme programmatically. Use
the follow utility function to achieve this:

```ts
import {
    isDarkMode, metaPerformDarkMode, toggleDarkMode, performDarkMode, initDarkMode
} from "@friendofsvelte/toggle";
````

- `isDarkMode` is a boolean writable store that indicates if the appearance
  is dark or not.
- `metaPerformDarkMode` that accepts a boolean value to set the appearance.
- `toggleDarkMode` uses the `isDarkMode` store to toggle the appearance.
- `performDarkMode` uses the `metaPerformDarkMode` and passes the value of
  `isDarkMode` to it.
- `initDarkMode` is a function that initializes the `isDarkMode` store with
  the value of the `prefers-color-scheme` media query or the `appearanceMode` cookie,
  and initialize a listener.
